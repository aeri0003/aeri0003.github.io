        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Lizzie, and this is my 2<sup>nd</sup> time taking a program here at Algonquin. Last year, I took Music, Media, & Film Foundations, a one year program. I was originally registered for Baking & Pastry Arts Management, before attending orientation and finding out it was <em>definitely</em> not for me. I've had a lifelong interest in all things art, mostly music, and as of the past few years, mainly film and video.</p>
        <p>I live here in Ottawa with four of my best friends, three of which I met in my program last year, one who I met in high school in my home town, Peterborough. I'm really excited to see where this year in Ottawa, and this program at <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr> will take me in the near future.</p>
